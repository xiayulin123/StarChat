## 🚀 A Compact Messaging Application

Star Chat is a sleek and lightweight messaging application designed to facilitate seamless communication between users. It offers a delightful user experience and has been meticulously optimized to maximize its effectiveness.

## 🌟 Key Features

- 💾 Save Chat History: Never lose important conversations again.
- 👤 User Login and Registration: Securely create and access your account.
- 🎨 Intuitive User Interface: Enjoy a smooth and intuitive interface for a seamless messaging experience.

## 🛠️ Technical Details

Star Chat leverages React and JavaScript for both its frontend and backend. The app employs socket connections to establish real-time communication between the two ends. While it currently operates seamlessly on Android devices, compatibility testing for iPhones is in progress and coming soon.

## 🛠️ Installation

To run the frontend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
2. Install dependencies by running: `npm i`.
3. Start the server with: `npx expo start`.

To start the backend, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the "backend" directory.
2. Install dependencies by running: `npm i`.
3. Start the server with: `npm run start`.

For local testing using a virtual device, an emulator is required. We recommend using the Android Virtual Device (AVD) provided by Android Studio. If you don't have it, download and install Android Studio, create a new virtual device within your project folder, and connect to the app by typing "a" in the terminal once the frontend is running.

## 🚀 Usage

Star Chat empowers users to seamlessly record their chat history, securely create accounts, and log in. Exciting new features are currently in development and will be unveiled in the near future. Stay tuned for exciting updates!
