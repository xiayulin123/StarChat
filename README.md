# Star Chat

## A Compact Messaging Application

Star Chat is a lightweight messaging application designed for seamless communication between users. It provides a delightful user experience and has been optimized to maximize its effectiveness.

## Key Features

- Save chat history
- User login and registration
- Intuitive user interface for a seamless experience

## Technical Details

Star Chat utilizes React and JavaScript for both the frontend and backend. It employs socket connections to establish communication between the two. Currently, the app operates smoothly on Android devices and will undergo testing for iPhone compatibility in the future.

## Installation

To run the frontend, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the "frontend" directory.
2. Install dependencies by running the command: `npm i`.
3. Start the server with the command: `npx expo start`.

To start the backend, follow these steps:
1. Navigate to the "backend" directory.
2. Install dependencies by running the command: `npm i`.
3. Start the server with the command: `npm run start`.

To view the app on a local machine using a virtual device, an emulator is required. We recommend using the AVD (Android Virtual Device) provided by Android Studio. If you don't have it already, download and install Android Studio. Then, within your project folder, create a new virtual device. Once the frontend is up and running, use the emulator to connect to the app by typing "a" in the terminal.

## Usage

Star Chat enables users to record their chat history, create accounts, and log in securely. Exciting new features are in development and will be released in the future. Stay tuned for updates!
